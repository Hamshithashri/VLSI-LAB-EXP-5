# SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE
# AIM:
To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Vivado 2023.2.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
Vivado 2023.2

**PROCEDURE: **
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.
